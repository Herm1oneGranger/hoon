## Contribution Guidelines

## Configure Git and correct EOL handling
Here you can find the references for [Dealing with line endings](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/ "Wiki page from Social Coding"). 

Every time you press return on your keyboard you're actually inserting an invisible character called a line ending. Historically, different operating systems have handled line endings differently.
When you view changes in a file, Git handles line endings in its own way. Since you're collaborating on projects with Git and GitHub, Git might produce unexpected results if, for example, you're working on a Windows machine, and your collaborator has made a change in OS X.

To avoid problems in your diffs, you can configure Git to properly handle line endings. If you are storing the .gitattributes file directly inside of your repository, than you can asure that all EOL are manged by git correctly as defined.
